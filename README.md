# TurnBasedStrategyGame
This was a project that I made in order to understand how one would approach making a turn based strategy game. This project is a stripped down version of the completed game named [Skeletons](https://angusfan.itch.io/skeletons)!
If you would like to hear how I programmed and designed certain aspects you can follow this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNSQWPhalGQ).
If you would like to download the Unity Project please download the **projectFiles.Zip** file and open it in Unity (you may need an older version).
